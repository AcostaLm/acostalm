ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Luis Acosta, a passionate Laravel developer who loves to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. ðŸ’»

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm developing a learning tool for factory operators to improve their workplace skills. When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me reading programming articles or experimenting with new libraries and frameworks.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about Laravel, PHP, or anything related to web development. And don't forget to invite me to your open source projects where I'll be happy to contribute.

ðŸŒ± In terms of skills and interests, besides Laravel development, I also enjoy front-end technologies like React.js and Flutter for mobile development. Additionally, I'm always looking for ways to improve my workflow and make my code more efficient.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding (which is rare!), you can usually find me playing video games or walking at my city.

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ˜Š
